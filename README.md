# Product-Review-Classification-using-Neural-Networks-and-NLP
This project centres on automating the sentiment analysis of customer reviews through deep learning. By applying natural language processing techniques and a PyTorch-based recurrent neural network, it accurately classifies reviews as positive,negative,or neutral.The system simplifies the process of analysing large feedbacks,to gain timely insights.
