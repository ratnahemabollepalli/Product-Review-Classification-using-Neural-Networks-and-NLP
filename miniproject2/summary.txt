
Project: Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning



The notebook contains a fully functional workflow for sentiment analysis of review text data, built using PyTorch and standard NLP techniques.

1. Data Loading and Exploration

   * Imports a dataset from data.csv.
       Initial dataset size: 5,000 entries.
       After removing duplicates: 4,052 entries remain.
       Sentiment distribution:

    * Neutral – 3,437
    * Positive – 511
    * Negative – 104

2. Data Pre-processing

   * Custom function for sentiment labelling (positive, negative, neutral).
   * Text cleaning using regular expressions to remove unwanted characters, URLs, and punctuation.
   * Lemmas produced via WordNetLemmatizer.
   * Removal of stopwords with NLTK.
   * All steps combined into a single utility function preprocess_text().

3. Model Design

   * Implemented using PyTorch with an LSTM-based architecture:

        Embedding layer to represent words as dense vectors.
        Stacked LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies.
        Fully connected layers for final classification.
   * Trained with Adam optimiser and cross-entropy loss.

4. Model Evaluation

   * Data split into training and test sets.
   * Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score calculated.
   * Confusion matrix plotted for visual inspection.
   * Training curves and evaluation metrics visualised.
