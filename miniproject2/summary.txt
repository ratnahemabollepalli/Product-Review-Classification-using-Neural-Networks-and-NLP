Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning raw text (removing URLs, punctuation, stop characters).
Expanding very short reviews with heuristic rules.
Tokenization, vocabulary building, padding.
Heuristic sentiment labeling (positive, negative, neutral).


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Distribution of review lengths (words & characters).
Sentiment distribution (pie chart).
Word clouds for positive, negative, and neutral reviews.


Model Architectures:
SimpleNN: Embedding + Flatten + Fully Connected.
LSTM: Standard LSTM with dropout.
BiLSTM: Bidirectional LSTM with advanced dropout, noise injection, and batch normalization.


Training & Evaluation:
Train/Validation/Test split.
Accuracy and loss monitoring across epochs.
Comparison of models (plots for loss & accuracy).


Model Saving & Reloading:
All models and preprocesing objects (vocab, label encoder) are saved in ./saved_models.
Models are reloaded safely (torch.serialization.add_safe_globals).


Final Results:
Evaluated on a held-out Test Set.
Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
Comparison of Validation Accuracy vs Test Accuracy.
Best performing model is automatically selected.
